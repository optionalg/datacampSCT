#' Check which functions were called by a student
#' 
#' Function takes the user code as input, and returns a character vector with the names of the functions
#' called by a student.
#' In case the code provided by a student cannot be parsed (which happens for example when the student code contains a syntax error), 
#' the function returns an empty character string.
#' 
#'  @param code The string containing the code submitted by the user. 
#'  The default is \code{DM.user.code} which contains the student code submitted to the DataCamp server (automagically). 
#'  This means you don't have to specify this argument when writing SCTs for DataCamp.com.
#'  
#'  @examples
#'  DM.user.code = "x=rnorm(100);mean(x = 1:10,);sum(x)"
#'  # Return the functions that were called in DM.user.code
#'  called_functions()
#'  
#'  @export
called_functions = function(code = DM.user.code) {

  }
