\title{Check which functions were called by a student}
\usage{
called_functions(code = DM.user.code)
}
\arguments{
\item{code}{The string containing the code submitted by the user.
 The default is \code{DM.user.code} which contains the student code submitted to the DataCamp server (automagically).
 This means you don't have to specify this argument when writing SCTs for DataCamp.com.}
}
\description{
Function takes the user code as input, and returns a character vector with the names of the functions
called by a student.
In case the code provided by a student cannot be parsed (which happens for example when the student code contains a syntax error),
the function returns an empty character string.
}
\examples{
DM.user.code = "x=rnorm(100);mean(x = 1:10,);sum(x)"
 # Return the functions that were called in DM.user.code
 called_functions()
