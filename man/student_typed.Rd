\title{Test whether the student code contains a certain string}
\usage{
student_typed(string, code = DM.user.code)
}
\arguments{
\item{string}{The string you would like to find in the student's code.}

\item{code}{The string containing the code submitted by the user.
The default is \code{DM.user.code} which contains the student code submitted to the DataCamp server (automagically).
This means you don't have to specify this argument when writing SCTs for DataCamp.com.}
}
\description{
Returns either \code{FALSE} in case the student didn't type the string, or the number of occurrences in the code.
Both for the submitted student code (\code{code} argument)
as well as for the string you want to test (\code{string} argument) it holds that:
\enumerate{
\item the white spaces are ignored,
\item \code{;} and new lines are ignored,
\item \code{TRUE} / \code{T}, and \code{FALSE} / \code{F} are considered as the same string
\item it doesn't matter if the student uses \code{=} or \code{<-} for assignment.
}
This function is useful when it's hard to check e.g. a function call with \code{\link{function_has_arguments}},
or when it would be too slow to do a real comparison,
or when you want to check whether the student used a certain type of notation.
}
\examples{
DM.user.code = "for (i in 1:2) { x[i] = rnorm(1E6) }"
# Return the number of times a student typed:
student_typed("for(i in 1:2")
# Has the student used the notation 1E6?
student_typed("1E6")
}
