# datacampSCT

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/datacamp/datacampSCT.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/datacamp/datacampSCT)

The `datacampSCT` package is a set of help functions that enable you to quickly test student code and to give feedback to a student on what is wrong/right in an exercise. This package is no longer used in DataCamp's new courses. Refer to the [`testwhat` package](https://www.github.com/data-camp/testwhat) for an improved way of writing so-called submission correctness tests.
